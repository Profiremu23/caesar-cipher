# caesar-cipher
This is my first Ruby project as a part for my Odin Project (TOP) journey, on which I created a functioning Caesar Cipher program to demonstrate some of my Ruby skills learned in the Odin Project's Ruby course. The program is capable to warp from letter z to a and keeps the same case after shifting.

# How to Run It?
After downloading it, in order to execute the program, you need to enter "ruby ./caesar_cipher.rb" on a Git terminal, where the program asks you to enter a string and a number.
